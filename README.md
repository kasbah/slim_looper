#Slim Looper 
##About
Slim Looper is the SooperLooper improved Looper (yes, that's "Looper" twice): a re-write of SooperLooper. SooperLooper is a live-looping sampler capable of immediate loop recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more.

Slim Looper is currently under active development and not really usable yet. If you are looking for a live-looping program to use check out [SooperLooper][1]
